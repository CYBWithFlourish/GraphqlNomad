**GraphQLNomad** is a powerful command-line tool designed for security researchers, bug bounty hunters, and developers to streamline the process of testing GraphQL endpoints. It automates reconnaissance and provides a feature-rich interactive shell to explore schemas and craft custom queries.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Endpoint Detection**: Automatically discovers GraphQL endpoints using a built-in and customizable wordlist.
*   **Engine Fingerprinting**: Identifies the underlying GraphQL engine (e.g., Apollo, Hot Chocolate, Hasura) based on its behavior.
*   **Schema Introspection**: Fetches the entire GraphQL schema and parses it for queries, mutations, and types.
*   **Interactive Shell**: A user-friendly interactive console to explore the schema, view object details, and build queries on the fly.
*   **Non-Interactive Mode**: Run scans and output results to a CSV file for automation and scripting.
*   **Connection Options**: Full support for custom headers, HTTP/S proxies, and request timeouts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install GraphQLNomad from multiple sources.

#### From PyPI (Recommended)
This is the easiest and fastest way to get started.

```bash
pip install pipx
```

```bash
pipx install graphqlnomad
```

#### From NPM
For users in the JavaScript ecosystem, an npm wrapper is available.
*(Note: Python and pipx are still required.)*

```bash
npm install -g graphqlnomad
```

#### From Source
To get the latest development version, you can install directly from this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CYBWithFlourish/GraphQLNomad.git
cd GraphQLNomad
pip install .
```

## üöÄ Usage

GraphQLNomad is simple to run. At its most basic, just provide a base URL to scan.

```bash
graphqlnomad [URL] [OPTIONS]
```

The tool will then attempt to find the endpoint, fingerprint it, and if successful, will drop you into an interactive shell.

#### Command-line Options

```
usage: graphqlnomad [-h] [-v] [--no-detect] [--no-fingerprint] [-w WORDLIST] [-l] [-H HEADER] [-p PROXY] [-T TIMEOUT] [--no-redirect] [--non-interactive] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] url

GraphQLNomad v1.0.0: An integrated tool to detect, fingerprint, and explore GraphQL endpoints.

positional arguments:
  url                   The target base URL or specific GraphQL endpoint URL.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

Reconnaissance Options:
  --no-detect           Do not attempt to find the endpoint automatically.
  --no-fingerprint      Do not attempt to fingerprint the engine.
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Path to a custom wordlist file for endpoint detection.
  -l, --list-engines    List all fingerprintable GraphQL engines and exit.

Connection Options:
  -H HEADER, --header HEADER
                        Add a custom header. Format: 'Header-Name: Header-Value'
  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        HTTP(S) proxy URL. Format: http://user:pass@host:port
  -T TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
                        Request timeout in seconds (default: 15).
  --no-redirect         Do not follow 3xx redirection.

Execution Options:
  --non-interactive     Exit after reconnaissance is complete.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output reconnaissance results to a CSV file.
```

## üí° Examples

#### 1. Basic Reconnaissance on a Domain
Scan a target URL, find the endpoint, and start an interactive session.
```bash
graphqlnomad https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql
```

#### 2. Non-Interactive Scan with Output
Scan a known endpoint, disable fingerprinting, and save the results to a CSV file.
```bash
graphqlnomad https://api.spacex.land/graphql --no-detect -o spacex.csv --non-interactive
```

#### 3. Using the Interactive Shell
Once in the shell, you can use these commands:
*   `help`: Show the list of available commands.
*   `queries`: List all available queries from the schema.
*   `mutations`: List all available mutations.
*   `info <TypeName>`: Show detailed information about a specific query, mutation, or type.
*   `run query <QueryName>`: Start the interactive query builder to craft and execute a request.
*   `exit`: Close the interactive session.
